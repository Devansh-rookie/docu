# Architecture Overview

This section provides detailed information about Docu's architecture, design decisions, and internal workings.

## Design Philosophy

Docu was designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Simplicity**: Keep the core functionality simple and focused
2. **Flexibility**: Support different documentation styles and output formats
3. **Extensibility**: Make it easy to add new features and customizations
4. **Proximity**: Documentation should be close to the code it describes

## High-Level Architecture

At a high level, Docu consists of the following components:

1. **Parser**: Extracts documentation from Python files

   - AST-based parsing for accurate code analysis
   - Special `#/` comment extraction

2. **Processors**: Process and structure the extracted documentation

   - DocStyle parsers for different documentation styles
   - Type information extraction

3. **Generators**: Generate documentation in different formats

   - Markdown generator
   - HTML generator with template support

4. **Templates**: Customizable templates for HTML output

   - Template management system
   - Multiple built-in templates

5. **CLI**: Command-line interface for easy usage

## Data Flow

The general flow of data through Docu is as follows:

1. Python file is parsed to extract code structure and comments
2. Documentation is extracted from special `#/` comments
3. Documentation is processed according to the specified style
4. Structured documentation is generated in the requested format
5. Output is either returned as a string or saved to a file

## Key Components

Here's a more detailed look at the key components:

### Parser Component

- Uses Python's AST module to parse Python code
- Extracts documentation comments with the `#/` prefix
- Identifies code structure (classes, functions, methods)
- Extracts type annotations and return types

### Processing Component

- Handles different documentation styles (Google, NumPy, Sphinx)
- Structures documentation into consistent format
- Associates documentation with code elements

### Generation Component

- Converts structured documentation to output formats
- Handles template rendering for HTML output
- Manages file output when saving documentation
